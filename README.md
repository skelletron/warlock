# Skelletron's Warlock

Learn how to become a warlock - a servant of an eldritch horror or cosmic entity.

**Recommended game version:** `1.4.4`. It may work on newer versions, but this is unsupported.

## About

This mod is unfinished and may never be finished. You may encounter a bug or two. But what's there is brilliant and works well. If you're interested in making your character live forever, manipulating the fertility of yourself & others, creating controlled and uncontrolled hordes of undead, then this mod is one you will enjoy.

Message from Cheb Gonaz:

> This mod was created for private use but it's so damn good I was able to convince Skelletron to allow me to make it public so that everyone may enjoy it and benefit from it.
>
> Skelletron has since moved on from CK3 modding and I don't have much time to invest into improving/maintaining this mod but I'll do my best.

## Getting Started

- Choose Decisions
- Choose the "Choose your Start" option
- Pick one of the three options:
	+ "I am an established Warlock" - the easiest start which sets you up as a fully fledged warlock.
